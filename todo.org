* basic functionality of org->sexp [4/5]
** DONE translates org header structure into a nested sexp
** DONE [#A] if header of level N is followed by a header of level N+x, make this header exactly N+x deeply nested in sexp, not just N+1 as it now
** DONE [#C] removal of leading whitespaces into org-header-format-str-sexp 
** TODO [#B] support for non-header (doen't start with asterics) text such as comments, #+ blocks of text; non-specific
*** DONE [#A] BUG non-headers in org->sexp cause endless cycle
** DONE [#A] solve the bug with empty header

* basic functionality of sexp->org [0/3]
** TODO [#B] traslates sexp into a correct org header structure, structuraly identical to the original if sexp was obtained from org->sexp
** TODO [#C] insertion of leading whitespaces into org-header-format-sexp-str
** TODO [#B] support for non-header (doen't start with asterics) text such as comments, #+ blocks of text; non-specific

* advanced functionality of org->sexp [0/1]
** TODO support for non-header text, but specific

* advanced functionality of sexp->org [0/1]
** TODO support for non-header text, but specific

* qa [1/6]
** DONE [#A] add unit-testing before proceeding further
** TODO [#B] add custom test that checks only the correct structure of sexp, not the headers (so we can discard different formatting)
** TODO [#A] start using the same principle for choosing [] and () for beatiful code; maybe adopt some racket formatting standard
** TODO [#B] variable and function names to use same vocabulary and logic across the code
** TODO [#B] good documentation formatting
** TODO [#B] maybe put common functions separetely?
